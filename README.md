[Otlet's Shelf](http://otletsshelf.tumblr.com) originated as a Tumblr theme and an Amazon bookmarklet, designed and developed by [Andrew LeClair](http://www.andrewleclair.com/) & [Rob Giampietro](http://www.linedandunlined.com/). This is its [Siteleaf](http://siteleaf.com) port.

## About Otlet's Shelf

> Named for [Paul Otlet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Otlet) — a librarian and visionary who popularized the 3x5 index card catalog and whose work in the early 1900’s prefigured the Internet — Otlet’s Shelf is a project in the spirit of free information exchange.

> Share a summer reading list. Keep track of the books on your physical shelves. Organize references around a subject of interest. Publish a wishlist. However you use it, Otlet’s Shelf is a simple tool which aims to turn the private act of collection into something shared.
